# Automate My Life

Did you ever want to automate your *entire life*? Me too. I built this tool to integrate with my favourite note-taking platform [Notion](https://www.notion.so). I love using Notion for its lovely aesthetics and advanced database capabilities. This code is meant to run quietly on a server and reach out to my notion pages, reading info from the databases there and sending me notifications directly to phone. So far I am using it to:

* Send me reminders for when I have friends birthdays coming up
* Tell me what's in the diary for the day each morning
* Send little reminders and motivations during the day
